                    <h3>An in-depth look</h3>

                    <br>
                    <div class="i_text">As the project started, we had to transition from a very practical-based brief to a completely digital one. After spending more than a month working on my workbook, I was thrilled to do something digital.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I spent a long time trying to find a piece of text that I could animate. Looking back I should've spent longer looking into potential speeches or even poems, as the text I ended up using proved itself challenging. Nevertheless, I made the best of what I had. When life gives you lemons...</div>
                </div>
                <div class="i02">
                    <img src="storyboard_1.png" alt="Storyboard Initial">
                </div>
                <div class="i03">
                    <div class="i_text">The image above is the very first storyboard I tried to create with the final text I chose. It features the fictional character, "Cave Johnson" who is in front of a stage, giving a speech. That was part of the original direction that I wanted to take my animation. Cave Johnson is the voice behind the speech and is also a game from the game Portal 2. Portal 2 is a puzzle game, with a sense of humour and difficult puzzle-solving.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The concept I had in my head was that I wanted the animation to be an advert, which could promote the game digitally. That's the reason everything was so literal and emphasised the speech with visuals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The animation then continues with flowing text and literal visuals which I planned to have various transitions. It all culminates with lemons raining from the sky in a crazy, chaotic finale.

                <div class="i05">
                    <div class="i_text">One day I was browsing around a website called pexels.com (they provide royalty-free stock images) where I found the following photograph of a lemon tree.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="i06">
                    <img src="lemon_tree_raw.jpeg" alt="image of lemons on a lemon tree">
                </div>
                <div class="i07">
                    <div class="i_text">That photograph then inspired me, and I opened up photoshop. I then separated the leaves and placed them on different layers, which allowed me to add a depth effect later on in After Effects.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="i08">
                    <img src="Lemon_Tree_Top.gif" alt="gif of the photoshopped image">
                </div>
                <div class="i09">
                    <div class="i_text">At that time I had only that image to work with. However, it proved itself an invaluable addition to my ideation process. I started animating with it, trying to get the ideas out of my head and on my computer. Then I sketched up a quick draft of what I had done so far, and what I wanted to do with it. </div>

                <div class="i12">
                    <div class="i_text">I was in the studio when an idea struck me. I swiftly moved a desk in position, took a photo of it with my tablet and drafted a few quick ideas. The idea was simple - display a green-screen on my laptop monitor, and then I could record a video moving around the desk and place anything on the screen and/or in the background in post production.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="i14">
                    <div class="i_text">My quick sketch then lead on to multiple videos from multiple angles that I could use. From there I could take those videos and apply them to my final storyboard.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="i15">
                    <div class="i_text">In conclusion, the storyboard helped me visualise my ideas quickly. However, I mostly created my storyboards after I had done a piece of animation. That slowed me down a lot. I had to first spend some time to animate and only then I could illustrate it in my storyboards.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The many iterations I had for my storyboards proved useful, as I had a reference and guidance of what my aims were. As my animation progressed I decided not to storyboard the ending as I had it clear in my head. Plus, I wanted to experiment further with my animation.</div>
